    A wallpaper daemon.
    Walld automatically changes the wallpaper. It sets the wallpaper through feh. It changes the wallpaper by default every 30 minutes.
    Walld has a feature that grabs the 16 most prominent colors from the wallpaper that it has set. Walld puts them in a file located at $HOME/.walld/colors. This file can be included in your .Xresources. Walld then reloads your .Xresources with xrdb.
