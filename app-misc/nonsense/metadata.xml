Nonsense generates random (and sometimes humorous) text from datafiles and
templates using a very simple, recursive grammar. It's like having a million
monkeys sitting in front of a million typewriters, without having to feed or
clean up after them.  From fake Slashdot headlines to absurd college courses to
buzzword bingo cards, Nonsense is a good way to waste time.

Whether this program has any practical applications is open to debate. I use it
to produce the names for characters and places in the fake news articles I
write for Humorix.  You might be able to use it as an alternative to fortune(6)
or as a way to add random content to your website.
