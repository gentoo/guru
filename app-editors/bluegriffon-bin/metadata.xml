	<longdescription lang="en">BlueGriffon
		The next-gen Web and EPUB Editor based on the rendering engine of Firefox

		« My HTML Editor is BlueGriffon, an intuitive, modern and robust application.
		I like that what I see is what I get on the Web. »
		Jeff Jaffe, CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

		« The HTML Editor I'm Using Today? BlueGriffon »
		Nick Longo, author of CoffeeCup, the very first HTML Editor

		« Dear @BlueGriffonApp , you saved my a$$ once again »
		Tristan Nitot, former President of Mozilla Europe

		BlueGriffon is a WYSIWYG content editor for the World Wide Web. 
		It is based on the discontinued Nvu editor, which in turn is based on the Composer 
		component of the Mozilla Application Suite. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox,
		it can edit Web pages in conformance to Web Standards. It runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux.

		BlueGriffon complies with the W3C's web standards. It can create and edit pages in accordance 
		to HTML 4, XHTML 1.1, HTML 5 and XHTML 5. It supports CSS 2.1 and all parts of CSS 3 already 
		implemented by Gecko. BlueGriffon also includes SVG-edit, an XUL-based editor for SVG that is 
		originally distributed as an add-on to Firefox and was adapted to BlueGriffon.

		A version without the CSS Stylesheet editor is free to download and is available on Microsoft Windows, 
		macOS and Linux.

		Many enhancements are available via add-ons. Most add-ons such as 'Project Manager', 'CSS Stylesheet editor',
		'MathML Editor', 'Word Count' and 'FullScreen view/edit' must be paid for, 
		while only two ('FireFTP' and 'Dictionaries') are free to download.
