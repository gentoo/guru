# Each command has 4 possible elements:
#   * `cmd`   : the AT command itself, which will be translated to "AT+`cmd`"
#   * `subcmd`: the subcommand in case a single AT command can be used
#               to change multiple parameters, such as QCFG (optional)
#   * `value` : the commands, argument, usually used to set the value of
#               a specific parameter (optional)
#   * `expect`: the expected return value; the command is first executed
#               without any value in order to query the current state. This
#               state is then compared to the `expect` string; if they don't
#               match, the command is then executed with value `expect` in
#               order to set the parameter to the configured value (optional)
# A command can have `expect` OR `value` configured, but it shouldn't have both
