    SMCRoute is a UNIX/Linux tool to manage and monitor multicast routes. It
    supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routing.

    SMCRoute can be used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers like
    mrouted or pimd in setups where static multicast routes should be maintained
    and/or no proper IGMP or MLD signaling exists.

    Multicast routes exist in the UNIX kernel as long as a multicast routing
    daemon runs. On Linux, multiple multicast routers can run simultaneously
    using different multicast routing tables.
