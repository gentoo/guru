		flux is a blazing-fast, async command-line downloader for Linux and Windows.
		It uses segmented range requests, adaptive scheduling, and mirror-aware balancing
		to squeeze as much bandwidth as possible out of every host.
		
		Features:
		- Async Rust core built on Tokio and Reqwest with rustls
		- Segmented multi-connection downloads with dynamic concurrency tuning
		- Robust resume support via .kdl.partmap sidecar files
		- Mirror awareness to balance segments across multiple URLs
		- Bandwidth shaping with a leaky-bucket limiter
		- Automatic preallocation to reduce fragmentation
		- Optional SHA256 verification
		- Rich progress reporting with adaptive TTY output or JSON streaming
