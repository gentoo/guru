		This library implements OAuth 1.0 and not OAuth 2.0.

		This code was originally forked from Leah Culver and Andy Smith's oauth.py code. Some of the tests come from a fork by Vic Fryzel, while a revamped Request class and more tests were merged in from Mark Paschal's fork. A number of notable differences exist between this code and its forefathers:

		100% unit test coverage.
		The DataStore object has been completely ripped out. While creating unit tests for the library I found several substantial bugs with the implementation and confirmed with Andy Smith that it was never fully baked.
		Classes are no longer prefixed with OAuth.
		The Request class now extends from dict.
		The library is likely no longer compatible with Python 2.3.
		The Client class works and extends from httplib2. It's a thin wrapper that handles automatically signing any normal HTTP request you might wish to make.
