  <longdescription lang="en">
A high level, “more Pythonic” interface to the PKCS#11 (Cryptoki) standard to support HSM and Smartcard devices in Python.

The interface is designed to follow the logical structure of a HSM, with useful defaults for obscurely documented parameters. Many APIs will 
optionally accept iterables and act as generators, allowing you to stream large data blocks for symmetric encryption.

python-pkcs11 also includes numerous utility functions to convert between PKCS #11 data structures and common interchange formats including PKCS #1 
and X.509.

python-pkcs11 is fully documented and has a full integration test suite for all features, with continuous integration against multiple HSM platforms including:
Thales nCipher 
Opencryptoki TP
OpenSC/Smartcard-HSM/Nitrokey HSM
