A comprehensive, fast, pure-Python memcached client.

pymemcache supports the following features:

Complete implementation of the memcached text protocol.
Connections using UNIX sockets, or TCP over IPv4 or IPv6.
Configurable timeouts for socket connect and send/recv calls.
Access to the "noreply" flag, which can significantly increase the speed of writes.
Flexible, modular and simple approach to serialization and deserialization.
The (optional) ability to treat network and memcached errors as cache misses.
