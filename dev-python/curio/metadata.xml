Curio is a coroutine-based library for concurrent Python systems programming. It provides standard programming abstractions such as as tasks, sockets, files, locks, and queues. It works on Unix and Windows. You'll find it to be familiar, small, fast, and fun
Core Features

Curio supports standard synchronization primitives (events, locks, recursive locks, semaphores, and condition variables), queues, subprocesses, as well as running tasks in threads and processes. The task model fully supports cancellation, task groups, timeouts, monitoring, and other features critical to writing reliable code.
