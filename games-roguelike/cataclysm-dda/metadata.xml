		Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a
		post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game",
		there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh,
		persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead
		civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full
		tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a
		wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to
		killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others
		like yourself, who want what you have...
