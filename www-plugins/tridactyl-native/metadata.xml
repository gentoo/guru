    This small application allows Tridactyl to communicate with your system, allowing Tridactyl to read files on your
    computer, including "RC" configuration files; write files to your computer launch applications, including opening
    about:* tabs in Firefox and generally do arbitrary stuff in userspace. It therefore greatly increases the amount of
    damage bugs in Tridactyl can do to your machine, although, arguably, not to your life, since almost all of that is
    on the internet anyway.
