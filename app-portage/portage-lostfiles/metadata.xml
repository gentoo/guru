                A simple script to identify files not tracked by Portage package manager.
                        Notes
                Symlinks are not reported as lost as long as the link target exists and is tracked,
                this is the same behavior as implemented in `equery b path`.
                Some common paths are not reported (e.g.: `/etc/group`, `/etc/machine-id`, ...),
                those are defined in `IGNORED_PATHS` and `PKG_PATHS` in `lostfiles.py`.
                        Usage
                git clone https://github.com/gcarq/portage-lostfiles.git
                cd portage-lostfiles
                $ ./lostfiles.py
