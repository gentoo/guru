		Zita-ajbridge provides two applications, zita-a2j and zita-j2a. They
		allow to use an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide additional
		capture (a2j) or playback (j2a) channels. Functionally these are
		equivalent to the alsa_in and alsa_out clients that come with Jack,
		but they provide much better audio quality. The resampling ratio will
		typically be stable within 1 PPM and change only very smoothly. Delay
		will be stable as well even under worse case conditions, e.g. the Jack
		client running near the end of the cycle.
