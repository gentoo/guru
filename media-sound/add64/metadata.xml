	<longdescription lang="en">Add64 implements Additive Synthesis for creating new sounds that are not accessible to
		any other synthesis method. Due to its large number of parameters, Additive Synthesis
		has never really reached much popularity. Add64 is therefore designed to provide fast
		real-time access to all parameters. A set of two 24-stage filters has been added to map
		complex spectral alterations onto a set of only a few parameters. Emphasis has also been
		put on modulations, both in the filter as well as the spectral design sections
