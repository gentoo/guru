# image-utils vs guest-utils is a distinction that does not actually exist
# upstream, but is rather one that arch linux makes. alpine goes even more
# fine-grained, creating a single package for each individual utility. I ain't
# maintaining all that, but I do think the distinction arch makes is worthwhile.
#
# The difference is this: is the tool something you would want to use within a
# cloud VM, or use outside of a cloud VM to manipulate your VM's disk image?
# This is useful, because the image manipulation scripts need qemu-img and
# cdrtools around, which you might not want to install onto a VM just to run
# something like `ec2metadata` or `growpart`
IUSE="+guest-utils +image-utils"

# cloud-utils also provides its own growpart, which is I think different from
