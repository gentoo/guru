    This is an emacs mode for editing Idris code.

    This mode was original designed to work with version 1 of the
    language through an IDE-Protocol. Idris2 uses the next iteration
    of the same protocol. Idris-mode tries to maintain compatibility
    with both protocol versions, however, not all the features from
    the IDE-Protocol have been realised in Idris2. When using
    idris-mode with Idris2 your experience might be a bit clunky.
