	Think of sensible.vim as one step above 'nocompatible' mode: a universal
	set of defaults that (hopefully) everyone can agree on.

	* If you're new to Vim, you can install this as a starting point, rather
	than copying some random vimrc you found.

	* If you're pair programming and you can't agree on whose vimrc to use,
	this can be your neutral territory.
	
	* If you're administrating a server with an account that's not
	exclusively yours, you can `scp` this up to make things a bit more
	tolerable.

	* If you're troubleshooting a plugin and need to rule out interference
	from your vimrc, having this installed will ensure you still have some
	basic amenities.
