        Given a path on your hard-drive (which could also be the root path,
        eg. /). diskonaut scans it and indexes its metadata to memory so that
        you could explore its contents (even while still scanning!).

        Once completed, you can navigate through subfolders, getting a visual
        treemap representation of what's taking up your disk space. You can
        even delete files or folders and diskonaut will track how much space
        you've freed up in this session.
