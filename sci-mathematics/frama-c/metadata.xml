Frama-C is a suite of tools dedicated to the analysis of the source code
of software written in C. It gathers several static analysis techniques
in a single collaborative framework. The collaborative approach of
Frama-C allows static analyzers to build upon the results already
computed by other analyzers in the framework. Thanks to this approach,
Frama-C provides sophisticated tools, such as a slicer and dependency
analysis.
