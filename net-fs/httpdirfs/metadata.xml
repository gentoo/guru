        A filesystem which allows you to mount HTTP directory listings, with a permanent cache.
        Now with Airsonic / Subsonic support!
        Have you ever wanted to mount those HTTP directory listings as if it was a partition?
        Look no further, this is your solution.
        HTTPDirFS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Directory Filesystem.
        The performance of the program is excellent.
        HTTP connections are reused due to the use of curl-multi interface.
        The FUSE component runs in multithreaded mode.
        There is a permanent cache system which can cache all the file segments you have downloaded,
        so you don't need to these segments again if you access them later.
        This feature is triggered by the --cache flag.
        This makes this filesystem much faster than rclone mount.
        The support for Airsonic / Subsonic server has also been added.
        This allows you to mount a remote music collection locally.
