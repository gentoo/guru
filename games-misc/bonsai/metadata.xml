bonsai.sh is a bonsai tree generator for the terminal, written entirely in bash. It 
intelligently creates, colors, and positions the tree, and is entirely configurable via 
CLI options- see usage.
There are currently four supported modes: static (the default), live, infinite, and neofetch, with more on the way! See Modes for documentation, and TODO for full list of goals.
