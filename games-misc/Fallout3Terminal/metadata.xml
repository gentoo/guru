Fallout3Terminal is my own version of a Fallout 3/4/NV Terminal operating system, complete 
with the ability to write journal entries, and in-game sounds from Fallout 3 itself! I 
tried to recreate as many little details there are in the games, like the RobCo OS header 
and such, though you will notice I took quite a few liberties.

This is actually just a bash script that can be run from the terminal, and the output is 
displaying on a highly customizable retro terminal called cool-retro-terminal.

See my demonstration video of this on reddit, the post can be found here:
