<longdescription>
	the_Foundation is a C11 library and a coding convention for
	object-oriented programming that has been designed from the point of
	view of someone who appreciates the user-friendliness of Qt and some of
	the thinking behind C++ STL. The preprocessor is used heavily to provide
	flexibility and convenience for the programmer.
