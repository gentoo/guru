A small C library with that portably invokes native file open, folder select and save dialogs. Write dialog code once and have it pop up native dialogs on all supported platforms. Avoid linking large dependencies like wxWidgets and Qt.

This library is based on Michael Labbe's Native File Dialog (mlabbe/nativefiledialog).

Features:

Lean C API, static library -- no C++/ObjC runtime needed
Supports Windows (MSVC, MinGW), MacOS (Clang), and Linux (GCC, Clang)
Zlib licensed
Friendly names for filters (e.g. C/C++ Source files (*.c;*.cpp) instead of (*.c;*.cpp)) on platforms that support it
Automatically append file extension on platforms where users expect it
Support for setting a default folder path
Support for setting a default file name (e.g. Untitled.c)
Consistent UTF-8 support on all platforms
Native character set (UTF-16 wchar_t) support on Windows
Initialization and de-initialization of platform library (e.g. COM (Windows) / GTK (Linux)) decoupled from dialog functions, so applications can choose when to initialize/de-initialize
Multiple file selection support (for file open dialog)
Support for Vista's modern IFileDialog on Windows
No third party dependencies
Modern CMake build system
Works alongside SDL2 on all platforms
Optional C++ wrapper with unique_ptr auto-freeing semantics and optional parameters, for those using this library from C++

Comparison with original Native File Dialog:

The friendly names feature is the primary reason for breaking API compatibility with Michael Labbe's library (and hence this library probably will never be merged with it). There are also a number of tweaks that cause observable differences in this library.

Features added in Native File Dialog Extended:

Friendly names for filters
Automatically appending file extensions
Support for setting a default file name
Native character set (UTF-16 wchar_t) support on Windows
Initialization and de-initialization of platform library decoupled from file dialog functions
Modern CMake build system
Optional C++ wrapper with unique_ptr auto-freeing semantics and optional parameters

There is also significant code refractoring, especially for the Windows implementation
