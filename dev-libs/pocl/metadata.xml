PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the OpenCL standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truely heterogeneous) open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this project is improving interoperability of diversity of OpenCL-capable devices by integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform. Also one of the key goals longer term is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL programs across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda, HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see: OpenASIP). It is also known to have multiple (private) adaptations in active production use.

PoCL uses Clang as an OpenCL C frontend and LLVM for kernel compiler implementation, and as a portability layer. Thus, if your desired target has an LLVM backend, it should be able to get OpenCL support easily by using PoCL.
