		The Fortran Template Library (FTL) is a general purpose library for Fortran 2003. 
		Its intention is to bring all these nice things we take for granted in modern languages 
		like Python and C++ to the Fortran world: Generic containers, versatile algorithms, 
		easy string manipulation, and more. 
		It is heavily inspired by C++'s standard library, 
		especially the part that is commonly referred to as the Standard Template Library (STL).
