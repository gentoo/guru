	QHttpEngine provides a simple set of classes for developing HTTP server
	applications in Qt. The design goals of QHttpEngine include:
	Reliability - extremely exhaustive test suite ensures that bugs are caught
	as soon as they are introduced.
	Flexibility - classes are designed for easy integration with existing Qt
	code.
	Simplicity - everything is intentionally kept as simple as possible.
	Usability - documentation is provided for all classes.
	All of QHttpEngine's functionality is included in a single monolithic
	library.
