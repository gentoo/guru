	Verible is a suite of SystemVerilog developer tools, including a parser,
	style-linter, and formatter.
	The Verible project's main mission is to parse SystemVerilog
	(IEEE 1800-2017) (as standardized in the SV-LRM) for a wide variety of
	applications, including developer tools.
	It was born out of a need to parse un-preprocessed source files, which is
	suitable for single-file applications like style-linting and formatting.
	In doing so, it can be adapted to parse preprocessed source files, which is
	what real compilers and toolchains require.
	The spirit of the project is that no-one should ever have to develop a
	SystemVerilog parser for their own application, because developing a
	standard-compliant parser is an enormous task due to the syntactic
	complexity of the language. Verible's parser is also regularly tested
	against an ever-growing suite of (tool-independent) language compliance
	tests at https://symbiflow.github.io/sv-tests/.
	A lesser (but notable) objective is that the language-agnostic components
	of Verible be usable for rapidly developing language support tools for
	other languages.
