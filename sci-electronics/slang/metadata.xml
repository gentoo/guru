	slang is a software library that provides various components for lexing,
	parsing, type checking, and elaborating SystemVerilog code. It comes with
	an executable tool that can compile and lint any SystemVerilog project,
	but it is also intended to be usable as a front end for synthesis tools,
	simulators, linters, code editors, and refactoring tools.
	slang is the fastest and most compliant SystemVerilog frontend
	(according to the open source chipsalliance test suite).
