	HP Unified Linux Driver.
	There are HP devices that are not supported by the HPLIP software but
	require the Samsung Unified Linux Driver (ULD) software for printing or
	scanning. Some such devices have PPDs and drivers in
	uld-hp_V1.00.39.*.tar.gz and uld-hp.tar.gz. 
	The names of these packages and their contents have been known to change,
	so it may very well be best to search for them using a printer model.
	The devices catered for by the packages above are
	* HP Color Laser 15x Series
	* HP Color Laser MFP 17x Series
	* HP LaserJet MFP M433
	* HP LaserJet MFP M436
	* HP LaserJet MFP M72625 72630
	* HP Laser10x Series
	* HP Laser MFP 13x Series
	A concise guide to installing the ULDLINUX package and setting up a
	USB-connected print queue with an appropriate PPD has been provided by
	Robert Nurnberg.
	Adapting the guide for a wireless connection should not be difficult.
