    Chawan is a text-mode web browser and pager for Unix-like systems, with a focus on implementing modern web standards
    while remaining self-contained, easy to understand and extensible. It includes functionality like CSS, inline images
    inside the terminal, and JavaScript through a small, independent browser engine. Most of Chawan has been developed
    from scratch in the memory-safe Nim programming language. Supports HTTP(S), SFTP (using libssh2), FTP, Gopher,
    Gemini, Finger, Spartan, and user defined protocols
