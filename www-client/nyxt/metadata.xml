      Nyxt [n√Ωkst] is a keyboard-driven web browser designed for power users. Inspired by Emacs and Vim, it has familiar keybindings (Emacs, vi, CUA), and is infinitely extensible in Lisp.

      Attention: Nyxt is under active development. Feel free to report bugs, instabilities or feature wishes.
