# Tests are skipped because as of version 0.3.0, the tests only validate
# resource files and do not verify any functionality of the program.  Those
# validations are either already handled by QA checks or not relevant on
# Gentoo.  For more information about the rationale, please refer to:
# https://github.com/gentoo/guru/commit/f896bee213fbb62c70e818c1bf503fee2a41919a#comments
#
# If tests are to be executed in the future because the upstream adds
# functionality tests or for other reasons, and should there be no convenient
# way to skip the validations, the following variable values need to be set:
#
# IUSE="test"
# RESTRICT="!test? ( test )"
# BDEPEND="test? ( dev-libs/appstream-glib dev-util/desktop-file-utils )"
