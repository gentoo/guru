    lsp(1) is a terminal pager with a focus on manual pages.

    It offers some assistance in handling manual pages:

    * Navigation to other referenced manual pages.
    * Opening of any manual page by name.
    * Maintainance of several open manual pages in a session.
    * Experimental TOC mode that is helpful to show only sections and
      subsections of manual pages.
    * Creating a pseudo-file with the output of apropos.
      This could be useful especially for novice users: this can be
      used to search or read through all manual pages' short descriptions
      and immediately open interesting ones.
