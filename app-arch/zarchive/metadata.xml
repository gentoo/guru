	ZArchive is yet another file archive format. Think of zip, tar, 7z, etc. but with the requirement of allowing random-access reads and supporting compression.

	- Supports random-access reads within stored files
	- Uses zstd compression (64KiB blocks)
	- Scales reasonably well up to multiple terabytes with millions of files
	- The theoretical size limit per-file is 2^48-1 (256 Terabyte)
	- The encoding for paths within the archive is Windows-1252 (case-insensitive)
	- Contains a SHA256 hash of the whole archive for integrity checks
	- Endian-independent. The format always uses big-endian internally
	- Stateless file and directory iterator handles which don't require memory allocation
