		TCPSER turns a PC serial port into an emulated Hayes compatible
		modem that uses TCP/IP for incoming and outgoing connections.
		It can be used to allow older applications and systems designed
		for modem use to operate on the Internet. TCPSER supports all
		standard Hayes commands, and understands extended and vendor
		proprietary commands (though it does not implement many of
		them). TCPSER can be used for both inbound and outbound
		connections.
