	For converting between different versions of .dwg and .dxf
	ODA File Converter application features a graphical interface and a
	command-line interface.
	Upon execution, the application identifies all files in the specified
	source directory that match the specified filter, then loads and saves each
	of these files to the specified output directory as the specified output
	version/type.
	If the audit flag is enabled, an audit/repair operation will be applied to
	each file as it is loaded.
	If the recursive flag is enabled, subdirectories within the source
	directory will be processed recursively.
