Purpose

The main purpose of svgcleaner is to losslessly reduce the size of an SVG image, created in a vector editing application, before publishing.

Usually more than half of an SVG image's data is useless for rendering. For example:

    Temporary data used by the vector editing application
    Non-optimal SVG structure representation
    Unused and invisible graphical elements

... Are all unnecessary in a published SVG.
Goals

    Correctness - svgcleaner should not break an SVG file
    Cleaning ratio - Higher is better
    Performance - An average SVG file processing time should be closer to ~1ms on a modern PC

Alternatives

    svgo
    scour

In addition to the main advantages of svgcleaner — like correctness, cleaning ratio and performance, which are described below — there are some more nuances to be aware of:

    svgcleaner cleans only one SVG file. It doesn't process SVGZ files. It doesn't process directories. It doesn't do anything else. Just one task*.
    svgcleaner is strictly lossless by default. There are no destructive cleaning options enabled by default.
    svgcleaner is portable. You can build it into a single executable without any external dependencies.

* You can get all of these features using the GUI.
