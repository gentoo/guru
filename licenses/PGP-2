[Note: The following is the original MIT license agreement, as included
in the PGP 2.6.2 distribution. Please observe that PGP 2.6.3i does not
use RSAREF, and so points 2 and 4 (first part) of this license do not
apply to PGP 2.6.3i. Bug reports for PGP 2.6.3i should be addressed to
pgp-bugs@ifi.uio.no, and will be forwarded to pgp-bugs@mit.edu when
relevant.]
