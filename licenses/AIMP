	3.2. Authorization of Third Party Services

Third party services can be authorized using a username and password (Basic Authorization) or using OAuth, that allowing us to avoid working directly with usernames and passwords, replacing them with a user_id (unique user identifier) ​​and access_token (used to confirm authorization when sending requests to the service). In Basic Authorization mode, the application is forced to store credentials to re-use these to access the service in the future. To ensure data security, these credentials are stored in app in encrypted form. You can revoke authorization to third-party services at any time. This can be done both via the service itself or through the app:
	• For cloud storages (OneDrive, Dropbox, Yandex.Disk, etc.), simply remove cloud storage from the list using the remove command from the context menu.

Data is only stored in the app settings folder in binary form (unreadable without special tools). Local copies of the data are deleted automatically upon revocation of authorization (see Section 3.5) or on deletion of this software completely using our uninstall tool.

	• OneDrive: offline_access - increases the lifetime of the access_token (see Section 3.2), thereby reducing the number of user re-authorization requests. Files.Read - this permission is required in order to obtain a list of files (audio files) located in the user's cloud storage for further playback.
	• WebDAV: despite the fact that when using the WebDAV protocol services do not request specific permissions, the application actually gets full access to the cloud storage and this software works only with audio files and only in "read-only" mode.
