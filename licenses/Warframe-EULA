11. GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION

a. Negotiations - To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this License Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Digital Extremes agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. Digital Extremes will send its notice by email to you at the email address you have provided to create your Warframe account. You will send your notice to Digital Extremes Ltd. by submitting a Support Ticket through Customer Support at http://support.warframe.com or alternatively by mail to 250 York Street, Ste 100, London, Ontario, N6A 5P2, Canada.

b. Binding Arbitration - If you and Digital Extremes are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or DE may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the jurisdiction of Canadian courts. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this License Agreement, you and DE may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

c. Restrictions - You and Digital Extremes agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between DE and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

d. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration - You and Digital Extremes agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or DE’s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.

12. MISCELLANEOUS

This License Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and Digital Extremes with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Digital Extremes; provided however, that this License Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy. To the extent that the provisions of this License Agreement conflict with the Terms of Use, the conflicting provisions in the Terms of Use shall govern. The Game is operated by Digital Extremes in Canada. Those who choose to access the Game from locations outside Canada do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. Digital Extremes’ failure to enforce any provision of this License Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by Digital Extremes of any provision, condition or requirement of this License Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. If any provision of this License Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The provisions of Sections 2, 3, 4 and 8 through 12 shall survive any termination of this License Agreement. If you have any questions concerning these terms and conditions, or if you would like to contact Digital Extremes for any other reason, please contact Digital Extremes through its website at http://www.digitalextremes.com/contact .
