RSA LABORATORIES, A DIVISION OF RSA DATA SECURITY, INC. ("RSA")
GRANTS YOU A LICENSE AS FOLLOWS TO THE "RSAREF" PROGRAM:

1.   LICENSE. RSA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
     perpetual (subject to the conditions of Section 8) license for
     the "RSAREF" program (the "Program") and its associated
     documentation, subject to all of the following terms and
     conditions:

     a.   to use the Program on any computer;

     b.   to make copies of the Program for back-up purposes;

     c.   to modify the Program in any manner for porting or
          performance improvement purposes (subject to Section 2)
          or to incorporate the Program into other computer programs 
          for your own personal or internal use, provided that you 
          provide RSA with a copy of any such modification or 
          Application Program by electronic mail, and grant RSA a
          perpetual, royalty-free license to use and distribute such
          modifications and Application Programs on the terms set
          forth in this Agreement.

     d.   to copy and distribute the Program and Application Programs
          in accordance with the limitations set forth in Section 2.

"Application Programs" are programs which incorporate all or any
portion of the Program in any form. The restrictions imposed on
Application Programs in this Agreement shall not apply to any
software which, through the mere aggregation on distribution media,
is co-located or stored with the Program.

2.   LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE.

     a.   RSA owns the Program and its associated documentation and
          all copyrights therein. You may only use, copy, modify and
          distribute the Program as expressly provided for in this
          Agreement. You must reproduce and include this Agreement,
          RSA's copyright notices and disclaimer of warranty on any
          copy and its associated documentation. The Program and any 
          Application programs must be distributed with their source code.

     b.   The Program may not be used directly for revenue-generating
          purposes. You may not:

          (i)  use the Program to provide services to others for which
               you are compensated in any manner;

          (ii) license or otherwise distribute any Application Program
               in any manner that generates income to you, including
               without limitation any income on account of license
               fees, royalties, maintenance fees and upgrade fees; and

          (iii) license or otherwise distribute any Application
               Program without the express written acknowledgment of
               the end user that the Program will not be used in
               connection with any revenue-generating activity of the
               end user.

          Nothing in this paragraph prohibits you from using the
          Program or any Application Program solely for internal
          purposes on the premises of a business which is engaged in
          revenue-generating activities.

     c.   The Program, if modified, must carry prominent notices
          stating that changes have been made, and the dates of any
          such changes. 

     d.   Prior permission from RSA in writing is required for any
          modifications that access the Program through ways other
          than the published Program interface or for modifications
          to the Program interface. RSA will grant all reasonable
          requests for permission to make such modifications.

3.   NO RSA OBLIGATION. You are solely responsible for all of your
     costs and expenses incurred in connection with the distribution
     of the Program or any Application Program hereunder, and RSA
     shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility therefor.
     RSA shall have no obligation to provide maintenance, support,
     upgrades or new releases to you or to any distributee of the
     Program or any Application Program.

4.   NO WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE. THE PROGRAM AND ITS ASSOCIATED
     DOCUMENTATION ARE LICENSED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY AS TO THEIR
     PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF
     THE PROGRAM IS ASSUMED BY YOU AND YOUR DISTRIBUTEES. SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU AND YOUR DISTRIBUTEES (AND NOT RSA)
     ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
     CORRECTION.

5.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN
     SECTION 6 HEREINUNDER, NEITHER RSA NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS
     BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, OR DELIVERY OF THE
     PROGRAM SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
     DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF RSA HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.   PATENT INFRINGEMENT OBLIGATION. Subject to the limitations set
     forth below, RSA, at its own expense, shall: (i) defend, or at
     its option settle, any claim, suit or proceeding against you on
     the basis of infringement of any United States patent in the
     field of cryptography by the unmodified Program; and (ii) pay any
     final judgment or settlement entered against you on such issue in
     any such suit or proceeding defended by RSA. The obligations of
     RSA under this Section 6 are subject to: (i) RSA's having sole
     control of the defense of any such claim, suit or proceeding;
     (ii) your notifying RSA promptly in writing of each such claim,
     suit or proceeding and giving RSA authority to proceed as stated
     in this Section 6; and (iii) your giving RSA all information
     known to you relating to such claim, suit or proceeding and
     cooperating with RSA to defend any such claim, suit or
     proceeding. RSA shall have no obligation under this Section 6
     with respect to any claim to the extent it is based upon (a) use
     of the Program as modified by any person other than RSA or use of
     any Application Program, where use of the unmodified Program
     would not constitute an infringement, or (b) use of the Program
     in a manner other than that permitted by this Agreement. THIS
     SECTION 6 SETS FORTH RSA'S ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE
     REMEDIES CONCERNING CLAIMS FOR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT.

     NOTE: Portions of the Program practice methods described in and
     subject to U.S. Patents Nos. 4,200,770, 4,218,582 and 4,405,829,
     and all foreign counterparts and equivalents, issued to Leland
     Stanford Jr. University and to Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology. Such patents are licensed to RSA by Public Key
     Partners of Sunnyvale, California, the holder of exclusive
     licensing rights. This Agreement does not grant or convey any
     interest whatsoever in such patents.

7.   RSAREF is a non-commercial publication of cryptographic
     techniques. Portions of RSAREF have been published in the
     International Security Handbook and the August 1992 issue of Dr.
     Dobb's Journal. Privacy applications developed with RSAREF may be
     subject to export controls. If you are located in the United States
     and develop such applications, you are advised to consult with the
     State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.

8.   TERM. The license granted hereunder is effective until
     terminated. You may terminate it at any time by destroying the
     Program and its associated documentation. The termination of your
     license will not result in the termination of the licenses of any
     distributees who have received rights to the Program through you
     so long as they are in compliance with the provisions of this
     license.
