4. Limited Warranty. 

Thales warrants, for your benefit alone, that the Licensed Product, when and as delivered to you, and for a period of ninety (90) days after the date 
of delivery to you, will perform in substantial compliance with the Documentation, provided that it is used on the computer hardware and with the 
operating system for which it was designed.  Non-substantial variation of performance from the Documentation does not establish a warranty right.  

5. Warranty Disclaimer. 

THALES DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF ITS PRODUCT(S) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ITS OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. 
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THALES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES NOT STATED HEREIN AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO THALES DEALER, DISTRIBUTOR, CHANNEL PARTNER, 
RESELLER, AGENT OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS, EXTENSIONS, OR ADDITIONS TO THIS WARRANTY. 
If any modifications are made to the Licensed Product by you during the warranty period; the Licensed Product has not been properly installed, 
operated, repaired or maintained in accordance with the instructions supplied by Thales; the Licensed Product has been subjected to abnormal 
physical or electrical stress, negligence or accident; or if you violate any of the terms of this License Agreement, then the warranty in 
Section 4 above, shall immediately be terminated. The warranty shall not apply if the Licensed Product is used on or in conjunction with hardware or  
programs other than the unmodified version of hardware and programs with which the Licensed Product was designed to be used as described in the Documentation.

6.  Limitation of Remedies. 

In the event of a breach of this warranty, Thales's sole obligation shall be, at Thales's sole discretion: (i) to replace or repair the Licensed Product, 
or component thereof, that does not meet the foregoing limited warranty, free of charge, or (ii) to refund the price paid by you for the Licensed Product,
 or component thereof. Any replacement or repaired component will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer.
 Warranty claims must be made in writing during the warranty period and within seven (7) days of the observation of the defect accompanied by evidence 
satisfactory to Thales. All Licensed Products should be returned to the Reseller, Distributor or Channel Partner from which they were purchased 
(if not purchased directly from Thales) and shall be shipped by the returning party with freight and insurance paid. The Licensed Product 
or component thereof must be returned with a copy of your receipt.

7.  Maintenance and Support. 

Thales has no obligation to provide support, maintenance, upgrades, modifications, or new releases under this License Agreement.

8. Limitation of Liability. 
IN NO EVENT WILL THALES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS 
INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF THALES HAS BEEN ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THALES'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE 
WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED PRODUCT AND DOCUMENTATION OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE PURCHASE PRICE, BUT SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED $1,000. 
THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  BECAUSE SOME STATES/COUNTRIES 
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
