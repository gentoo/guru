GlueGen is a tool which automatically generates the Java and JNI code necessary
to call C libraries. It reads as input ANSI C header files and separate
configuration files which provide control over many aspects of the glue code
generation. GlueGen uses a complete ANSI C parser and an internal representation
(IR) capable of representing all C types to represent the APIs for which it
generates interfaces. It has the ability to perform significant transformations
on the IR before glue code emission. GlueGen is currently powerful enough to
bind even low-level APIs such as the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the AWT
Native Interface (JAWT) back up to the Java programming language.
