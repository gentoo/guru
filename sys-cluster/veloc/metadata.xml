  <longdescription lang="en">VeloC is a multi-level checkpoint/restart runtime that delivers high performance and scalability for complex heterogeneous storage hierarchies without sacrificing ease of use and flexibility.
It is primarily used as a fault-tolerance tool for tightly coupled HPC applications running on supercomputing infrastructure but is essential in many other use cases: suspend-resume, migration, debugging.
VeloC is a collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the Exascale Computing Project.
