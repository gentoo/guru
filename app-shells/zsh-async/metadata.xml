		With zsh-async you can run multiple asynchronous jobs, enforce
		unique jobs (multiple instances of the same job will not run),
		flush all currently running jobs and create multiple workers (each
		with their own jobs). For each worker you can register a
		callback-function through which you will be notified about the job
		results (job name, return code, output and execution time).
