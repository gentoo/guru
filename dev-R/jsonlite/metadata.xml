		A Simple and Robust JSON Parser and Generator for R // A
		reasonably fast JSON parser and generator, optimized for
		statistical data and the web. Offers simple, flexible tools for
		working with JSON in R, and is particularly powerful for
		building pipelines and interacting with a web API. The
		implementation is based on the mapping described in the
		vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to converting JSON data
		from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to stream,
		validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with
		the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded
		consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and
		applications.
