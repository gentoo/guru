Units ordered by service, timer, socket, and the rest.
Runs sudo automatically and only if necessary.
Filter units by state using ctrl-s or the --state option.
Run daemon-reload with ctrl-r.
Has short versions of systemctl commands to reduce typing.
Runs status after other commands (start, stop, restart, etc).
Select multiple units, states, and commands using TAB.
