# Since opencilk-project is a fork of LLVM 12, this lists the licenses
# of LLVM 12, while opencilk-project states that it us under "MIT with
# the OpenCilk Addendum", which basically states that you can
# distributed it under the LLVM licences. I am also not sure if OpenCilk
# is able to change the license of LLVM (which source code they use),
# hence this needs more investigation and we only list t he LLVM 12
# licenses, because those definetly are correct.
