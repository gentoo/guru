# The Swift backtracer needs to get CPU context information when producing
# backtraces, which is necessarily written in assembly. Because it tries to be
# portable, it doesn't include a note indicating that the assembled binary
# doesn't require an executable stack; we need to include one explicitly to turn
# it off.
