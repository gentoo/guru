# Individual preset options:
#
# 1. mixin-preset: building for Linux, without compiler assertions, and with
#    most tests disabled
# 2. build-ninja=0, skip-build-curl, skip-build-zlib: we'd prefer to pick these
#    up from the system
# 3. extra-cmake-options:
#    * -DLLVM_USE_LINKER, -DCLANG_DEFAULT_LINKER: build LLVM, clang, Swift, et.
#      al. to link using lld, and ensure Clang uses it as its default
#    * -DBUILD_TESTING, -DSWIFT_INCLUDE_TESTS, -DSWIFT_INCLUDE_TEST_BINARIES:
#      the `no_test` preset disables building most, but not all tests; we don't
#      need to build any of them
#    * -DCOMPILER_RT_BUILD_ORC: the `compiler-rt` library defaults to building
#      the ORC LLVM JIT library, which we don't require; we disable it because
#      it builds with executable stacks, which trip up warnings on installation
#    * -DPython3_FIND_UNVERSIONED_NAMES: LLDB ships with Python bindings, and
#      uses CMake to search for Python. By default, CMake tries to find the
#      latest version installed on disk (currently, `python3.13`, then
#      `python3.12`, then...). This might not be the version of Python specified
#      by `PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET`, which we want to respect. We use
#      `python_setup` to place `${EPYTHON}` at the front of `PATH` as the
#      unversioned `python3`, so we want CMake to discover and use this binary
#      first before falling back to its search
# 5. llvm-targets-to-build: we don't currently support architectures other than
#    amd64, so there's no point in building LLVM for multiple architectures; if
#    this changes (or we start supporting cross-compilation), we'll need to
#    build for more than just the host
