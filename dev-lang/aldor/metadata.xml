Aldor is a programming language. It is the successor of A# as the extension language of the Axiom computer algebra system.
The Aldor language combines imperative, functional, and object-oriented features. It has an elaborate dependent type system, allowing types to be used as first-class values. Aldor's syntax is heavily influenced by Pascal, but it is optionally indentation-sensitive, like Python. In its current implementation, it is compiled, but an interactive listener is provided.
