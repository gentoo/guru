		RHVoice is a free and open source speech synthesizer.

		Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small
		footprints, because only statistical models are stored on users'
		computers. And though the voices lack the naturalness of the
		synthesizers which generate speech by combining segments of the
		recordings themselves, they are still very intelligible and resemble
		the speakers who recorded the source material.

		Initially, RHVoice could speak only Russian. Now it also supports
		American English, Brazilian Portuguese, Esperanto, Georgian, Ukrainian,
		Kyrgyz and Tatar. In theory, it is possible to implement support for
		other languages, if all the necessary resources can be found or created.
