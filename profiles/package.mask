# Per profile masking in an overlay is currently not working
# with pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck. Masking this for all profiles
# as a workaround that both makes repoman happy and works with
# pkgcore/pkgdev/pkgcheck.
# Users of non-SELinux profiles can safely unmask this.
# Sorry for the inconvenience.

# TODO: Either fix per profile masking in overlays, or move
# this entry to the relevant package.mask files in ::gentoo
