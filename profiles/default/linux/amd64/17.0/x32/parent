# Paths relative to `profiles`. The first line denotes the
# parent profile which should inherit any changes we make here.
# The second line points to the location where the appropriate
# masks or forces(?) are. It is important to keep the
# changes separated per profile/feature in case a
# parent profile picks up on changes intended for a different profile.
