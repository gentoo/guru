    The Overlay Emerge Tool creates a sandboxed envronment for doing arbitrary 
    installation processess without changing your host system. Its primary use 
    is to make system updates with emerge. The updates will be put into binary 
    packages and transfered to the host package database and can then be 
    installed on the host, when all problems are fixed.
