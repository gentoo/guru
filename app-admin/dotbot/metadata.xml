		Dotbot is designed to be lightweight and self-contained, with no
		external dependencies and no installation required. Dotbot can also be
		a drop-in replacement for any other tool you were using to manage your
		dotfiles, and Dotbot is VCS-agnostic -- it doesn't make any attempt to
		manage your dotfiles.
