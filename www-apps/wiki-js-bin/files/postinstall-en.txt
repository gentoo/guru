INSTALLATION

You will need to create a table for your Wiki.js database.  This
assumes you have some knowledge of PostgreSQL, and already have it
installed and configured.  If not, please refer to the Gentoo PostgreSQL
guide at the following URL:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PostgreSQL/QuickStart

Log in to PostgreSQL, and create a new database as well as a user with full
access to this database. After that you will need to provide the details
of this database and the associated user within the file

${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.yml 

Finally you should be able to log in to Wiki.js at

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}:3000
