<longdescription lang="en">
tinyxxd is a standalone fork of xxd, a slight modernization of the C code, a slight performance increase and a drop-in
replacement for xxd. It contains the same logic and supports the exact same flags. tinyxxd can be useful in connection
with building and packaging software, since it's a smaller dependency than ViM, only requires a C11 compiler and is
slightly faster.
