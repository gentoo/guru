Babeltrace /ˈbæbəltreɪs/, an EfficiOS project, is an open-source trace manipulation toolkit.
The Babeltrace 2 project offers a library with a C API, Python 3 bindings, and a command-line tool which makes it very easy for mere mortals to view, convert, transform, and analyze traces.
Babeltrace 2 is also the reference parser implementation of the Common Trace Format (CTF), a very versatile trace format followed by various tracers and tools such as LTTng and barectf. The Babeltrace 2 library and its Python bindings can read and write CTF traces.
