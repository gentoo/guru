    mb2q analyses the complete mailbox and collects various tags (Reviewed-by,
    Acked-by, Tested-by) from replies to individual patches and to the cover
    letter. If a tag is in a reply to the cover letter it is applied to all
    patches which reference the cover letter.

    Optionally the output can be redirected into a mailbox which can be applied
    with git-am.
