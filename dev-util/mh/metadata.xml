		A small program you put in your Makefile to produce fancy help.
		mh parses the comments you put after targets and variables, and
		produces a help menu, which helps understanding what each target
		does. This is useful, if Makefile is used as a task launcher for
		different tools (e.g. wrapper around docker, yarn, npm and setup.py
		etc.)
